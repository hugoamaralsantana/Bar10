# Bar10
Become your home's bartender with a quick sign-up

The aim of this project is creating a website with the MERN stack (Mongoose, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS) that serves as a social media for home bartenders interested in
creating their own cocktails at home with the ingredients available to them.

The purpose of the project is to create a cocktail-sharing website where people can post, share, and save recipes for drinks. (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) The website would also implement a feature where users can input ingredients they have around the house and the website will display recipes that the user can make with what they have.

The idea came to me after looking for recipes online for a prawn dish and finding a recipe website that allowed for users to input their refrigerator's contents and recipes would
show up based on what the user had available to them. I found this really interesting and wanted to implement this towards another part of recipe sharing that lacks web
development implementation at this level. So I came up with the plan to use this idea to not only bolster my skills with the MERN stack but to also implement something that
might find some use for people interested in making home cocktails.

I currently put this project on hiatus due to my education since the pacing of my University demands a lot from my energy and time. Planning on continuing this project as soon as
possible in order to be the first bartending recipe-sharing website. This would also be nice to display the extent of my knowledge of the MERN stack.
